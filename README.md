# OVERTHROW SYNTHETICA

## Background

Enter Neu Kong, a wasteland of greed, corruption and oppression. Society is ruled by few major corporations, with Synthetica being the all but official dictator of wider society. As the spearhead of the project to develop artificial human androids, they quickly rose to power. But as some of these androids have gained true sentience, they have shown a more explicit ruthless and violent side.

You are part of the resistance: whose goal is to overthrow Synethetica! Avoid getting caught by officers or inquisitors as you play your part in the great rebellion: collect all of the data drives and deliver them to your informant and your part is done... for now.
